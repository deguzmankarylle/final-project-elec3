# Final Project ELEC3

## Project Type
Solo Project

## Description
This repository contains four web applications built as part of a solo student project for ELEC3. Each app demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrates with public APIs where applicable. The projects included are:
- Calculator
- HTTP Dog API Viewer
- Stopwatch
- Weather API App

---

## Project Overview
This project showcases fundamental web development skills through four interactive applications:

1. **Calculator**: A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
2. **HTTP Dog API Viewer**: Displays images of HTTP status code dogs using the HTTP Dog API.
3. **Stopwatch**: A digital stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality.
4. **Weather API App**: Fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location using a public weather API.

## Main Features
- Responsive and user-friendly interfaces
- Real-time API data fetching and display
- Modular, well-commented JavaScript code
- Clean and modern CSS styling

---

## APIs Used

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/final-project-elec3.git
```
Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

### 2. Run the Project Locally

1. Open the desired project folder (e.g., `calculator`, `weather-api`) in your code editor.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. For API-based apps (Weather API), you may need to insert your own API key in the `script.js` file.
